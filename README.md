# Interactive Portfolio — Antero Rodrigo

An experimental and interactive portfolio website inspired by **Windows XP UI**, **early 2000s web aesthetics**, and **bimbo / Y2K visual culture**.

This project was developed as a **freelance portfolio website**, blending frontend development with visual storytelling and creative direction.

## 🖥️ Concept

The website simulates a fictional operating system environment where the visitor navigates through windows, folders, image viewers, and sound interactions — turning the portfolio into an **experience**, not just a static page.

The aesthetic embraces digital nostalgia while maintaining a technically structured and scalable frontend architecture.

**Main references:**

* Windows XP interface & UI behavior
* Early 2000s personal websites
* Digital kitsch, glitter graphics & pop nostalgia

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (custom UI components & retro styling)
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* Web Audio API (UI sound feedback)

> No frameworks were used. All interactions and systems were built from scratch.

## ✨ Features

* Boot screen with loading simulation
* Draggable windows (XP-style behavior)
* Interactive desktop with icons
* Custom image viewer system
* Context menus & wallpaper system
* Sound feedback for UI interactions
